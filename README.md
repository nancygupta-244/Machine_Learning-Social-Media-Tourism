a) Defining problem statement.

      An aviation company that provides domestic as well as international trips to the customers now wants to apply a targeted approach instead of reaching out to each of 
      the customers.
      
      This time they want to do it digitally instead of tele calling.
      
      Hence they have collaborated with a social networking platform, so they can learn the digital and social behavior of the customers 
      Provide the digital advertisement on the user page of the targeted customers who have a high propensity to take up the product separately for both mobiles and laptops.

b) Need of the study/project.

      By leveraging digital tools and data analytics, the company aims to move away from mass marketing strategies towards a more focused and personalized approach. This 
      allows them to tailor their advertising efforts to specific segments of their customer base who are most likely to engage with their services.
      
      Traditional methods like tele-calling can be time-consuming and costly. By transitioning to digital advertising, the company can potentially reduce expenses associated 
      with outbound marketing while reaching a wider audience through social networking platforms.
      
      Collaboration with a social networking platform enables the company to gain valuable insights into the digital and social behavior of their customers. By analyzing 
      this data, they can better understand customer preferences, interests, and behaviors, allowing for more precise targeting of advertisements.
      
      By delivering targeted advertisements to users who are more likely to be interested in their services, the company can enhance the overall customer experience.
      
      Customers are more likely to appreciate relevant ads that align with their interests, leading to higher engagement and potentially increased conversions.
      
      In today's digital age, companies that effectively leverage data and digital advertising techniques gain a competitive edge. By adopting this targeted approach, the 
      aviation company can stay ahead of competitors and better position themselves in the market.


c) Understanding business/social opportunity

      The leading trends towards the Social Networking has drawn high public attention from past ‘two’ decades. For both small businesses and large corporations, social 
      media is playing a key role in brand building and customer communication. 
      
      Apart from social networking sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat etc, other categories like news, Communication, Commenting, Marketing, Banking, 
      Entertainment etc. are also generating huge social media content every minute.
      
      The understanding of the customer’s behaviors on a social media platform will result in targeting advertisements according to the needs and wants of the specific set 
      of customers that can result in high propensity to take up the product. 
      
      Apart from this company can understand the problems associated with the customers that have posted bad reviews.
      
      Then, instead of calling each and every customer, company can utilize its resources to improve revenue.
